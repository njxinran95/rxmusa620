## Notes

- See the [raw source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhand/static-site-template/master/_posts/2019-04-13-measles-charts.md) of this post for details on how these charts were embedded.
- See the [week 13 lecture slides](https://github.com/MUSA-620-Fall-2019/week-13/blob/master/lecture-13.ipynb) for the code that produced these plots.

**Important: When embedding charts, you will likely need to adjust the width/height of the charts before embedding them in the page so they fit nicely when embedded.**
